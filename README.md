File Directory Tree in Java

About this Program

File Directory Tree, is a console-based program that uses a tree structure to simulate a file directory. It allows users to create and navigate through directories in a hierarchical manner.


Features of this Program:

Create Subdirectory: Users can create child directories under the current directory.
List Subdirectories: Users can view all subdirectories in the current directory.
Navigate to Subdirectory: Users can move to a specific subdirectory.
Go Back: Users can return to the root directory (basic implementation for simplicity).
Exit: Users can exit the program.

Why I made this Program:

I made this program because I wanted to create a simple yet practical way to demonstrate how tree structures work in real-world scenarios. The idea of simulating a file directory system felt relatable and intuitive, making it easier for others to understand hierarchical data organization. It also helped me enhance my skills in programming and problem-solving by tackling challenges like navigation and data management.

How this Program can help to others:

This program helps others by showing how tree structures work in a simple and easy way. It teaches how to organize and navigate data, like in real-life file systems. Beginners can use it to learn basic programming and data concepts, while students and teachers can build on it for more advanced projects. Itâ€™s a helpful tool for understanding and practicing important computer science ideas.
